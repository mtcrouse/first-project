# first-project

The name of my project is Hike Finder. It is a website designed to find nearby hikes by returning all hikes within a certain radius of a city, state, address, or landmark. Hike Finder also provides an easy way to keep track of past hikes and hikes you'd like to complete in the future.

The website is intended for active people, perhaps new to an area or going on a vacation to an unfamiliar place, who would like to view their hiking options on one easy-to-navigate map. Hike Finder allows the user to control the address, number of results, state, and radius in miles around the origin in order to get the most helpful results possible. The individual results of a search include a brief description of the hike and a link to more information that includes reviews and directions.

This project used the Google Maps Javascript API, the Google Maps Geocoding API, and TrailsAPI. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Materialize.
